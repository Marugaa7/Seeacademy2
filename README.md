Certainly! Here’s a sample `README.md` file for your calculator script:

# Simple Python Calculator

This is a beginner-friendly Python script that takes two numbers from the user and calculates their sum, difference, product, and quotient. It’s a great example of basic input/output and arithmetic operations in Python, plus it’s beginner-approved with emoji-enhanced comments!

## Features

- Accepts two numbers (decimals welcome!)
- Calculates:
  - Sum
  - Difference
  - Product
  - Quotient
- Interactive: asks the user for input in the console

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed ([Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

### How to Run

1. **Copy the code to a new file**  
   Save the provided code in a file called `calculator.py`.

2. **Open your terminal or command prompt**  
   Navigate to the folder containing `calculator.py`.

3. **Run the script**  
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

4. **Follow the prompts**  
   Enter two numbers when prompted. The results for their sum, difference, product, and quotient will be displayed.

## Code Example

```python
# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Step 3: Compute the sum, difference, product, and quotient.
sum_result = num1 + num2
difference_result = num1 - num2
product_result = num1 * num2
quotient_result = num1 / num2

# Step 4: Print out the results
print(f"Results of your two numbers:")
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")  
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")  
print(f"Product: {product_result}")  
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")  
```

## Notes

- Division by zero is **not** handled; entering 0 as the second number will cause an error.
- Input is always converted to float to allow decimal calculations.
